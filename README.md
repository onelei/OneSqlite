# Database storage solution under Unity--OneSqlite

[OneSqlite]( https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/175529 
) is a data storage plugin under Unity, using Sqlite database to store data. Built-in a database storage method in the form of Key and Value consistent with PlayerPrefs under Unity. In general, the database is used by the server, and the client customizes the data storage format. However, as the functions of the game are becoming larger and larger, the data structure and storage methods are becoming more and more complex, and the simple Key and Value forms can no longer meet and have no needs. Therefore, the client database is introduced to store data more convenient. Of course, if the game content is not complicated and does not require too much storage content, it is also possible to directly use the PlayerPrefs that comes with Unity.
